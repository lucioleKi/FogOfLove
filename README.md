# FogOfLove

A console version of the two-player board game Fog of Love. Next step: Make a GUI version of Fog of Love. 

Please support the Fog of Love designers and buy the actual board game. I own a copy of this game. This coding project is personal and not for profit. I am a programmer, but not a game designer. I do not intend to encourage any copyright infringement or piracy here.

Next step: Testing, testing, testing...

8/8/2022

Testing is completed, but there are definitely bugs I didn't catch. My development for console version of Fog of Love comes to an end here. I will update if I fix more bugs in the future. Otherwise, I am glad to say that I have implemented the game I intended to make two months ago. The game is certainly not perfect, but the process was unforgettable and rewarding. 

I learned so much about C++ during the past two months. I completed 55 entries on my trello board. I thought developing a game by myself would be lonely and frustrating. It was a bit frustrating when certain bugs came up, but overall the experience was enjoyable, and not lonely at all. I was accompanied by Game Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom. This was an eye-opening first-book for me. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to develop games.

Cheers and off to my next jouney!

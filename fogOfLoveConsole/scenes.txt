1	THE STUPIDEST THING...?	What's the stupidest thing you've done in front of a crowd?	N	0	B	I've never done anything stupid.	In front of a crowd? Eh... Um... Nothing...	I once licked a frozen pole and my tongue got stuck. My friends had to call the firefighters to help me get free.	I accidentally kissed a kid from my class at a school play. On the mouth. In front of the whole school. It was in 7th grade. I still have nightmares.
2	HAPPY BIRTHDAY	Happy birthday, darling. Here's something special for you!	What does the PLAYER give, and what gift would the PARTNER prefer?	0	B	A lazy weekend at home playing games and eating pizza.	A blindfold, a bottle of champagne and a surprise.	An antique brooch with an embedded ruby.
3	WHO WOULD BE YOUR DREAM DINNER GUEST?	Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?	N	0	P	A movie star [tell about one].	An entrepreneur [tell about one].	A historical figure [tell about one].	My lovely grandmother, who passed away 12 years ago [tell about her].
4	ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT...	I bet you're thinking about...	PLAYER makes a guess about what the PARTNER is thinking.	0	B	Sex.	What we'll have for dinner.	A project at work.	Something sad.
5	WHAT DO YOU WANT TO AVOID?	I really want to know more about what you want to avoid in our relationship?	N	0	P	I really want to avoid...	I don't see any need to talk about this. Everything's fine.
6	A NEW LOOK	Since you got that haircut, I think more people are flirting with you.	How does the PARTNER react, and how does the PLAYER hope they react?	0	B	Yes, it's a bit overwhelming to finally be noticed.	Nah, I don't think so. Really?	Yeah. It's fun to see how those who would hit on you, also are flirting with me now. Wow. You're still way hotter than me in my eyes.
